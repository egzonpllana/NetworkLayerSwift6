/// A network interceptor that retries failed requests based on HTTP response status codes.
///
/// `RetryInterceptor` automatically retries requests that fail due to server errors (status codes 500â€“599).
/// It supports a configurable number of retry attempts with an exponential backoff strategy.
///
/// - Important: This interceptor does not execute the retries itself.
///   The actual retry mechanism must be implemented in the network client.
/// - Note: This implementation does not modify the request itself.
